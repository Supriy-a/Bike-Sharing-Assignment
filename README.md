## General Information
-Multiple linear regression is performed on the dataset.
-The project is done as part of coursework in the Machine Learning module.
-We are trying to find the number of rentals issued from the company based on numerous independent values such as temperature, weather, humidity, holiday, etc.
-The Boombikes bike rental dataset is being used.

## Conclusions
Train dataset R^2 : 0.838
Test dataset R^2 : 0.834
Train dataset Adjusted R^2 : 0.7958
Test dataset Adjusted R^2 : 0.785 
-Demand of bikes depend on year, holiday, temp, windspeed, sep, Light_snowrain, Misty, spring, summer and winter.
